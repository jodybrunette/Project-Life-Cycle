    "# Goals\n",
    "The goal of this project is to mimic the full data science life cycle, from data cleaning and feature selection to machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's [credit risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "(source: Dataquest.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from [Lending Club]](https://www.lendingclub.com/). Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data (and their own data science process!) and assign an interest rate to the borrower. The interest rate is the percent in addition to the requested loan amount the borrower has to pay back. You can read more about the interest rate that Lending Club assigns [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/public/borrower-rates-and-fees.action). Lending Club also tries to verify each piece of information the borrower provides but it can't always verify all of the information (usually for regulation reasons).\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher interest rate means that the borrower is riskier and more unlikely to pay back the loan while a lower interest rate means that the borrower has a good credit history is more likely to pay back the loan. The interest rates range from 5.32% all the way up to 30.99% and each borrower is given a [grade](https://www.lendingclub.com/public/rates-and-fees.action) according to the interest rate they were assigned. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are primarily interested in receiveing a return on their investments. Approved loans are listed on the Lending Club website, where qualified investors can browse recently approved loans, the borrower's credit score, the purpose for the loan, and other information from the application. Once they're ready to back a loan, they select the amount of money they want to fund. Once a loan's requested amount is fully funded, the borrower receives the money they requested minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The borrower then makes monthly payments back to Lending Club either over 36 months or over 60 months. Lending Club redistributes these payments to the investors. This means that investors don't have to wait until the full amount is paid off to start to see money back. If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time, however, and some borrowers default on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Lending Club has to be extremely savvy and rigorous with their credit modelling, investors on Lending Club need to be equally as savvy about determining which loans are more likely to be paid off. While at first, you may wonder why investors would put money into anything but low interest loans. The incentive investors have to back higher interest loans is, well, the higher interest! If investors believe the borrower can pay back the loan, even if he or she has a weak financial history, then investors can make more money through the larger additional amount the borrower has to pay.Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll **focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time**. To do this, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict whether a loan will be paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "(source: Dataquest.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club releases data for all of the approved and declined loan applications periodically on their [website](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). Any user can select a few different year ranges to download the datasets (in CSV format) for both approved and declined loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also find a [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191B2yJ4H1ZPXq0_ByhUgWMFZOYem5jFz0Y3by_7YBY4/edit) (in XLS format) which contains information on the different column names towards the bottom of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the datasets themselves, let's get familiar with the data dictionary. The **LoanStats** sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the **RejectStats** describes the rejected loans datasets. Since rejected applications don't appear on the Lending Club marketplace and aren't available for investment, we'll be focusing on data for the approved loans only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approved loans datasets contain information on current loans, completed loans, and defaulted loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining the Problem\n",
    "Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a borrower will pay off their loan on time?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and Feature Selection\n",
    "(source: Dataquest.io)\n",
    "Before we can start doing any machine learning, we need to define what features we want to use and which column repesents the target column we want to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll focus on approved loans data from 2007 to 2011 since a good number of the loans have already finished. In the datasets for later years, many of the loans are current and still being paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have reduced the size of the dataset to make it easier to work with, by:\n",
    "- removing the desc column:\n",
    "    - which contains a long text explanation for each loan\n",
    "- removing the url column:\n",
    "    - which contains a link to each loan on Lending Club which can only be accessed with an investor account\n",
    "- removing all columns containing more than 50% missing values:\n",
    "    - which allows us to move faster since we can spend less time trying to fill these values\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's start by reading in this dataset and exploring it."

Only the `Fully Paid` and `Charged Off` values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still on going and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance.\n",

    "One thing we need to keep in mind is the **class imbalance** between the positive and negative cases. While there are 33,136 loans that have been fully paid off, there are only 5,634 that were charged off. This class imbalance is a common problem in binary classification, and during training, the model ends up having a strong bias towards predicting the class with more observations in the training set and will rarely predict the class with less observations. The stronger the imbalance, the more biased the model becomes. "

With the exception of `addr_state` we should encode these columns as dummy variables and keep them. The `addr_state` column contains 49 discrete values and we'd need to add 49 dummy variable columns to use it for classification. This would make our Dataframe much larger and could slow down how quickly the code runs. Let's remove this column from consideration.\n",
